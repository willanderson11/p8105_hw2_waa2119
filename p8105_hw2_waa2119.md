# Homework 2

## Problem 1

First we will read in the data about entrance and exits for subway
stations in NYC

We will retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes
served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance then convert
the entry variable from character to a logical variable

``` r
subway_data = 
  read_csv("HW2_Data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%

  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = 1, "NO" = 0))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

This data contains information about the different subway lines in New
York City, the locations of their stations and the different routes they
operate on. This data set also has information on whether the entrance
types for the stations, whether the stations contain vendors and whether
they are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

-   The number of rows in this dataset are 1868 and the number of
    columns are 19

-   The number of distinct stations are 356

``` r
names_and_ada = distinct(subway_data, station_name, ada)

ADA_compliant = sum(names_and_ada$ada, na.rm = TRUE)
```

-   The number of ADA compliant stations is 73

``` r
station_vending_entrance = distinct(subway_data, station_name, vending, entry)

station_no_vending_entrance = filter(station_vending_entrance, vending != "YES", entry != 0)
```

-   The number of stations without vending that allow entrance are 42
